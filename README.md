These projects were made during the course Microcontrollers given by Dieter Vanrykel at University College PXL. The course uses the PSoC4 pioneer kit but students may also use the BLE4 or PSoC5 for these projects. 
A lot of projects were made since 2016, but only a few are published because of licencing, endresult or of interest for future development.
